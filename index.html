		<h2>About Me</h2>
	</div>

	<h4 id="walloftext">I am a full-time graduate student at Babson College, earning a Masters of Management with a focus on Entrepreneurship. Previously, I attended the University of Maryland Baltimore County where I received a BA in Media & Communications studies, while minoring in English, Entrepreneurship and Economics. Though my interests are varied and I am continuously drawn to new fields, I have a strong affinity for Business Strategy in Media and Technology.</h4>
